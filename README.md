nDjinn
======

Work in progress...

Basically an OpenGL wrapper library. The design goals for nDjinn are as follows:
* nDjinn should be header only to make it simple to include in small projects.
* Resource classes should be RAII and exception safe.
* Complicated OpenGL state should be easily accessible in a logical way through nDjinn interfaces.
* nDjinn should focus on correctness over speed and complex optimizations, debugging is more important than performance.
